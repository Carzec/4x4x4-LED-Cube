# 4x4x4-LED-Cube
Creating an LED cube for fun

This project was my favorite build so far! 
I decided to try and build a LED cube from scratch. That meant a lot of steps for me to do. This included the following:
-ordering LED bulbs
-shaping the LEDs legs into proper shape with a cardboard jig
-straightening wire and cutting it into correct length
-creating another jig to hold the LEDs while I soldered them to create a 4x4 layer
-repeated the process soldering process 3x
-soldered the layers onto a piece of blank PCB board
-soldered an arduino nano onto the PCB board
-repurposed quick connection cables to establish connections from cube to arduino nano
-uploaded code to nano
-3d printed a box for the LED cube to be placed in to hide the circuitry
-Plug into a powersource and let it run!
